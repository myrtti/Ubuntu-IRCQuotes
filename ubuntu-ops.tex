\section*{i'd jump off that sinking ship}

LjL is one of the oldest Ubuntu IRC operators, and he's the person behind
the FloodBots guarding \verb$#ubuntu$ and \verb$#kubuntu$. He's also Italian.

The news earlier the week were extensively covering 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Concordia_disaster}{Costa Concordia disaster},
which happened after a ship called Costa Concordia hit a reef off the Italian coast.

\end{verbatim}

The discussion moved swiftly to the merits of learning to type as Dave2
mistypes his irssi commands to change windows.
