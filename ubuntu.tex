< CT1> Hi all.  Is there a package (or a feature in audacity) that 
  plays a certain tone... changeable (subtly) via a GUI slider?  I'm 
  interested in finding out the frequency of the (yes, I may be 
  "mental") constant buzz/hum I hear.  It's essential in deciding if 
  I should be "committed" or if the tone is related to UK AC 
  frequency and its harmonics.

< CT1> genesisbot: Thankfully the humorous side of my question was 
  duly noted.  The subtle hint of it being a real question was 
  perhaps lost in it's "insanity"
\end{verbatim}

The discussion that followed included suggestions of coding an app that
could do what was requested (a slider to adjust pitch) with PyGame, or
setting up an Arduino board with a physical knob. \verb$*shakes head*$
