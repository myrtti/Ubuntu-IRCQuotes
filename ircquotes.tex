Ubuntu IRC channels in freenode thrive to be helpful, family-friendly 
and peaceful place to visit and get help for your problems related to 
Ubuntu Linux or just to relax with likeminded people. Discussion is quite 
fastpaced in the main channel of \verb$#ubuntu$, and can sometimes be quite 
quick in \verb$#ubuntu-offtopic$ as well, and special moments often go 
unobserved or they are forgotten quite soon after they've happened.

This collection of quotes, pamphlet or book, or a virtual photocopy, 
aims to be a collection of these special moments. Hopefully you'll 
have as much fun reading it as we've had living the moments and 
compiling them into this.
